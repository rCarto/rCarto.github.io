This blog aims to share and disseminate several spatial data science projects done thanks to the R software. This initiative is part of the broader framework of the development of free software, open data and reproducible research. Various of my works make use of resources (data, scripts, documents â€¦) that may be interesting to broadcast to the community of engineers and researchers in spatial data science.
