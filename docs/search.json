The purpose of getTiles() was to download and compose raster tiles from a large number of providers.\nFortunately, the maptiles package can be used to replace this function. It has the same features and is more robust.\nFor the same kind of reasons, smoothLayer() function has been deprecated. This function is using the SpatialPosition package to compute potentials. Potentials computations are now offered by the potential package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey messages for cartography users\n\n\n\n\nConsider switching from cartography to mapsf. mapsf is the successor of cartography, it offers the same core features, it is friendlier, lighter and more robust.\n\nUse maptiles instead of getTiles(). It offers the same features using a modern packages.\nUse potential instead of smoothLayer().

    "text": "What has changed\nThis major release introduces a number of changes to the package API, some of them are breaking changes.\n\nsp support\nUsers will no longer have the possibility to use an sp object as input or output in osrm functions. Most of #rspatial users and package developers have moved from the old sp/rgeos/rgdal trilogy toward the sf package.\n\n\nRefactoring of the request handling process\nThe way requests are sent to the OSRM server (local/remote/demo) has been refactored in order to get more informative messages. Indeed, an important share of the issues posted on the osrm GitHub repo has been about cryptic or non helpful error messages sent by the package or the server. So in this release OSRM server errors are more explicit and better transmitted to the user.\n\n\nDependencies\nOSRM request are received as json files to the package. Former versions of the package used jsonlite. Following a suggestion by Nick Young I’ve replaced this package by a much more efficient package (for large files), RcppSimdJson.\nThe construction of isochrones as polygons was based on an ad-hoc code supported by isoband. This piece of code was replicated in 2 other packages (tanaka and potential). I’ve decided to create the mapiso package to avoid an unnecessary maintenance burden and fortify the underlying code.\n\n\nInput types\nInput type checking has been largely improved. This improvement have lead to a modification of the set of valid input of functions. Most functions accept data.frame, matrix, sfc or sf objects. The way identifier are handled has also been improved (use of row.names or indexes if row.names are not relevant, e.g. for sfc objects or some matrices).\nSee the NEWS file for the complete list of changes."
