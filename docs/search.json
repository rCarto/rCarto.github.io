    "text": "Open Source Routing Machine, or OSRM (Luxen and Vetter 2011), is a routing software based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. OSRM can be used to find the fastest route between points, to compute time or distance matrices between set of points or to solve the traveling salesman problem.\nAs maintainer of the osrm R package (Giraud 2022) I often find myself advising users to use their own instance of OSRM to enable them to send a large number of requests and not overload the demo server. In these cases I simply point to the Docker installation instructions in the project’s README file. These instructions may not be detailed enough to build an OSRM instance on a large area.\nOSRM needs a lot of RAM to prepare the road network for requests and using only these instructions will probably result in message like this one:\nThis problem is addressed in this issue on the OSRM GitHub repository. The suggested solution is to rent a temporary server. This is not the only solution, a modern computer with a rather classical hardware configuration can actually do the job.\nIn this post I’ll explain how to build a European-wide OSRM instance on a desktop computer. These explanations are, to a certain extent, also valid when using a remote server."

The purpose of getTiles() was to download and compose raster tiles from a large number of providers.\nFortunately, the maptiles package can be used to replace this function. It has the same features and is more robust.\nFor the same kind of reasons, smoothLayer() function has been deprecated. This function is using the SpatialPosition package to compute potentials.

    "text": "osrm is an interface between R and the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) API. OSRM (Luxen and Vetter 2011) is a routing service based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. This package enables the computation of routes, trips, isochrones and travel distances matrices (travel times and kilometric distances) based on the OSM road network.\nA major update of osrm has been deployed on CRAN two weeks ago. In this article I’ll describe the changes introduced by this update and explain its context: the submission of a paper (Giraud 2022) about the package in Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)."

    "section": "What has changed",
    "text": "What has changed\nThis major release introduces a number of changes to the package API, some of them are breaking changes.\n\nsp support\nUsers will no longer have the possibility to use an sp object as input or output in osrm functions. Most of #rspatial users and package developers have moved from the old sp/rgeos/rgdal trilogy toward the sf package.\n\n\nRefactoring of the request handling process\nThe way requests are sent to the OSRM server (local/remote/demo) has been refactored in order to get more informative messages. Indeed, an important share of the issues posted on the osrm GitHub repo has been about cryptic or non helpful error messages sent by the package or the server. So in this release OSRM server errors are more explicit and better transmitted to the user.\n\n\nDependencies\nOSRM request are received as json files to the package. Former versions of the package used jsonlite. Following a suggestion by Nick Young I’ve replaced this package by a much more efficient package (for large files), RcppSimdJson.\nThe construction of isochrones as polygons was based on an ad-hoc code supported by isoband. This piece of code was replicated in 2 other packages (tanaka and potential). I’ve decided to create the mapiso package to avoid an unnecessary maintenance burden and fortify the underlying code.\n\n\nInput types\nInput type checking has been largely improved. This improvement have lead to a modification of the set of valid input of functions. Most functions accept data.frame, matrix, sfc or sf objects. The way identifier are handled has also been improved (use of row.names or indexes if row.names are not relevant, e.g. for sfc objects or some matrices).\nSee the NEWS file for the complete list of changes."

The handling editor will assign two or more JOSS reviewers, and the review will be carried out in the JOSS reviews repository. Authors will respond to reviewer-raised issues on the submission repository’s issue tracker.\nThe review process of the paper happens in the open. You can have a look at it here.\nSubmitting a paper to JOSS assure you to have your software inspected by a set of competent people and I can say that this process help me to make the package more ergonomic and reliable.\nIf you want more detailed information on JOSS, a paper by Smith et al.
